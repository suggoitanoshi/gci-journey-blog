Hello! I am  a student who participates in Google Code-In 2018. I go by the
alias vex8. I work with the coala organization, which is a cool organization. In
this blog, I will write a lot about my participation in GCI. It's fun in its own
way, really! My experiences are probably not much interesting, but I hope it can
be an inspiration for fellow newcomers who are still afraid of contributing in
OSS.

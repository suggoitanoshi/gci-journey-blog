When choosing a task, the first thing I would consider is the type of task. I
usually go with a code task, but sometimes quality assurance ones too. Then,
the next thing is I would consider the (programming) language the task is in.
Since I can't possibly learn a new language in such a short time, I would try
doing tasks in languages I'm familiar with.

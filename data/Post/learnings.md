I have been participating GCI since it started. So I should at least learn
something, right? And indeed, I do. I learned a lot of things while working at
tasks. For starters, I learned more about python. It might not be a lot, but I
could definitely write a wrapper bear for coala now. I also get to know a lot
about continuous integration and how it helps with maintaining good code base.
Turns out it is really important to keep it clean and simple. There's also
templating and stuff, which I found really interesting and hope to use in my
next project. Problem solving is also a thing, because you have to at least try
before asking, right?

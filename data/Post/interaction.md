You're trying to contribute, but you're not sure about a certain part of an
issue. What do you do? Well, you ask! One thing that you should always keep in
mind is that you're never expected to be able to do everything alone (although
sometimes it is good...). When you're stuck, you could always ask, and there
will be people who respond with clues you need. I also thought that I must be
able to do the tasks alone, but after getting stuck, I finally decided to ask at
the Zulip chat room. I found out that the community there is really friendly!
When mentors are busy, fellow students also help answering questions, so it is
really rare to see questions left unanswered for days. I sometimes help too,
although I feel like I haven't given much to the community. I really hope to
help more people, especially newcomers!

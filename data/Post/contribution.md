Contributing may be daunting at first glance, but with the help of community and
enough practice (yes!), you could contribute with ease! There are a few things
to remember, like the guidelines for commit messages. It might feel like too
much rule, but in my experience, it is better than no rules at all. Then, there
are tools that you need to be familiar with to produce, at the very least,
OK-quality code. I mean, coala itself is a tool to *enforce* rules to your code.
Continuous Integration is also used to run tests and everything else, so that
codes in master will always be manageable.

Before I write my experience on GCI, I want to talk about my prior experiences.
I participated GCI 2 years ago, which is my very first participation in these
kind of events. So yeah, I have *some* experience. Prior to that, I learned
programming since I was a kid. The first ever language I learned was Visual
Basic. Then I learned a lot of other languages, though not really deeply. I also
recently learned python, and coincidentally, coala uses python too. Back to my
experience on OSS, I have never contributed before, although I participated in
GCI. I was always overwhelmed when I visit other people's repositories. Then, I
finally tried to do tasks in GCI, and contributing isn't as hard as it seems.
I'll write about it in a separate post, up next!
